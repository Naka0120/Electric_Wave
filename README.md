# Electric Wave Simulation

This project simulates the propagation of one-dimensional electromagnetic waves using numerical methods. It provides tools for setting up simulations, solving wave equations, and visualizing the results.

## Features

- Simulation of electric and magnetic fields in one dimension.
- Visualization of wave propagation over time.
- Boundary condition handling to ensure realistic simulations.
- Example scripts and Jupyter notebooks for demonstration and exploration.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the simulation, execute the main script:

```
python src/electric_wave_py/main.py
```

You can also run the example simulation provided in the `examples` directory:

```
python examples/run_simulation.py
```

## Jupyter Notebook

For an interactive exploration of the simulation, open the Jupyter notebook located in the `notebooks` directory:

```
notebooks/demo.ipynb
```

## Testing

To run the unit tests for the simulation and visualization, use:

```
pytest tests/
```
